# PonyQ
PonyQ is a project that aims to simplify the [WikiaActivityLogger](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/WikiaActivityLogger) built by [@KockaAdmiralac](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac).

In doing so I hope to decrease the overall complexity of the application while preserving its core features while also making it more flexible by implementing language-agnostic system messages, configurable configuration files, as well as a much cleaner transport interface.

Ultimately the goal is to have changes made here merged into the main WikiaActivityLogger project but if this is seen as impossible then PonyQ will continue to exist in its current form and will receive updates inline from WikiaActivityLogger.

## Development
The development of PonyQ takes place within the Visual Studio Code editor and as such I have provided configuration for it in this repo. The extensions needed for this project are as follows:

* Prettier Now - `ext install prettier-now`

These plugins provide formatting of code on save so that the style is consistent across developers.

## Installing
To install simply clone this repository to your local machine and then run the `index.js` file.

## Uptading
To update simply issue the `git pull origin master` command.
